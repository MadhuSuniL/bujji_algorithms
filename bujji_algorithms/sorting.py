    Sorting Algorithms Module â€” Real World Usage Examples
    =====================================================

    1. Bubble Sort
       Scenario:
           Educational purposes or very small datasets.
       Benefit:
           Simple to understand but inefficient for large data.

    2. Selection Sort
       Scenario:
           Small datasets where memory writes are costly.
       Benefit:
           Minimizes swaps, good for memory-constrained environments.

    3. Insertion Sort
       Scenario:
           Nearly sorted data such as live data streams.
       Benefit:
           Very efficient on mostly sorted datasets.

    4. Merge Sort
       Scenario:
           External sorting of large datasets on disk.
       Benefit:
           Stable and O(n log n), suitable for linked lists and large data.

    5. Quick Sort
       Scenario:
           General purpose sorting in-memory.
       Benefit:
           Very fast average case, used widely in standard libraries.

    6. Heap Sort
       Scenario:
           Systems requiring guaranteed O(n log n) worst case.
       Benefit:
           In-place and no extra memory.

    7. Radix Sort
       Scenario:
           Sorting integers or fixed-length strings.
       Benefit:
           Linear time for small range integers.

    8. Counting Sort
       Scenario:
           Sorting small range integers efficiently.
       Benefit:
           Non-comparative, very fast for known limited ranges.

    9. Bucket Sort
       Scenario:
           Uniformly distributed data over a range.
       Benefit:
           Distributes sort workload for faster average sorting.

    10. Shell Sort
       Scenario:
           Medium-sized arrays with some unordered elements.
       Benefit:
           Improved insertion sort for distant elements.
